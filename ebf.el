INSTRUCTIONS is a list of symbols and vectors of symbols. Vectors
are accepted so we don't need to escape square brackets of our
brainfuck program. Symbols' names should be sequences of valid
brainfuck instructions excluding square brackets.

Evaluation of the macro expansion causes the brainfuck program
execution."
